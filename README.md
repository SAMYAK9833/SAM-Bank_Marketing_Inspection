# Bank Marketing Data Analysis

This project contains a detailed analysis of the **Bank Marketing** dataset, which includes records from a Portuguese banking institution's direct marketing campaigns. The goal is to explore customer behavior and build insights that could help in predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes information such as:
- Demographics (age, job, marital status, education)
- Financial products (housing loan, personal loan)
- Campaign contact details
- Socio-economic indicators

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**  
   Read and explore the `bankmarketing.csv` file to understand structure and contents.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Checked for null values and ensured the dataset is ready for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualized and interpreted key variables like job, education, month, duration, etc., and their influence on term deposit subscription.

4. **Insights Generation**  
   Observed patterns in customer responses to help guide marketing strategies.

5. **Model Building**  
   Trained and evaluated classification models to predict client subscription outcomes.

## Sample Observations

- Majority of contacts were made in the month of May.
- Duration of contact appears to be a strong predictor of subscription.
- Certain job types and education levels are more likely to subscribe.
